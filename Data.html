							<p>In this project, I undertook extensive data cleaning and transformation tasks to ensure that datasets were accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Using SQL, I addressed a variety of data quality issues, including missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect formatting.

                                I developed and executed SQL queries to identify and correct data anomalies, standardize formats, and enforce data validation rules. For example, I used UPDATE statements to correct inconsistencies and DELETE statements to remove duplicate records. I also created SQL scripts to normalize data, which involved restructuring and aggregating raw data into a format that was more suitable for analysis.
                                
                                In addition to cleaning and transforming data, I performed data integration tasks by combining datasets from different sources through complex JOIN operations. This integration process ensured that all relevant data was available in a cohesive format for further analysis. To enhance performance, I optimized SQL queries and implemented indexing strategies, which significantly improved query execution times and overall database efficiency.
                                
                                I documented all data cleaning and transformation processes, providing clear guidelines and explanations for the methods used. This documentation ensured reproducibility and clarity in the data handling process. The successful completion of this project demonstrated my proficiency in SQL and my ability to prepare data for meaningful analysis, ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making.</p>
